**Physics Controls:** Adjust **wavelength**, **frequency**, and **amplitude** to check out different interference scenarios!

**Multiple View Modes:** Toggle between individual waves, resultant wave, and interference pattern views!

## How the Physics Works

### Wave Superposition Logic

The simulation implements **electromagnetic wave superposition** using **sinusoidal wave equations**, with the resultant wave calculated by summing the instantaneous displacements of individual waves at each point in space, creating **constructive interference** when waves are in phase (amplitude doubles) and **destructive interference** when they're 180° out of phase (waves cancel).

### Interference Pattern Generation

The interference pattern is generated by calculating the path difference **ΔL = L₁ - L₂** between each source and points on the detection screen, with **bright fringes** occurring where **ΔL = nλ** (constructive interference) and **dark fringes** where **ΔL = (n + ½)λ** (destructive interference), while **phase control** allows users to shift interference patterns by adjusting the relative phase between sources, demonstrating how **coherent light sources** create stable interference patterns.

### Real-time Visualization System

The visualization engine samples **wave amplitudes** at discrete points across the screen, interpolating between them to create smooth wavefronts, with color coding distinguishing individual sources (red/blue) from the **resultant wave** (green), while the **detection screen** converts **wave intensity** into grayscale brightness values that show alternating bands of **constructive and destructive interference**.
